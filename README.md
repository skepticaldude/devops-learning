this is me documenting my devops journey here on github
## Goal 
Documenting my DevOps projects and progress.

## Current Progress

#latest update
In my latest lab, I focused on fundamental Linux commands for identifying user and system information—small commands, but very useful in everyday system work.

What I practiced:

Using whoami to identify the current logged-in user

Displaying the system date and time with date

Formatting output using options like +%R (time) and +%x (date)

Running multiple commands on a single line using a semicolon

This lab reinforced how efficiency in the command line comes from understanding simple tools and combining them effectively. These basics show up everywhere in scripting, automation, and system administration, so mastering them early matters.

#important sidenote!
If you know that a try...except block is the "safety net for errors" and a while loop is a "repeater," you can design solutions. 
this basically means this helps to keep the system stable and running regardless of encountering errors in our code, it's basically a saftey net for everything we're doing, then loop is simple a repeater as specified
i'll be moving this to my cherrytree but later, i have to complete my labs!
