still yet to work on this now im seeing it's a ![Node.js CI](hmmm/ci.yml/badge.svg) 


# Progress Update 10 feb 2026
* connected my first Virtual machine yesterday
* understanding more on what cloud computing is all about 
* and understanding that Devops is more of a culture than a live hard skill 


# Progress Update 18 feb 2026
it's been 8 days, i've lost touch with some concepts but i'm back on this 
working with GCP and also gemini CLI
### GSP001
* created a vm instance with GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
* i installed an NGINX Web server
* i also created a new instance with gcloud
looked around the console, saw load balancers and kubernetes, IAM and some other things, still yet to grasp those contexts, but now, i can clearly create a VM instance (basically a virtual machine), how to attribute specifications to the machine i work with 

# Progress Update 20 feb 2026
Forgot to include an update yesterday but i did a few things and started my google clouds learning properly 

# Progress Update 28 feb 2026
Just realised i don't code so much on saturdays and this should change, i guess
i think i should be building more, but i'll give a summary of what i've understood so far; 
* DevOps is basically a culture, how to use tools, how to manage pipelines, automation, CI/CD (Continous Integration and deployment)
* i've gotten more familiar with development tools
* the shell sounds more familiar, i understand how it can do the same thing with console and gui but the shell seems more intricate because you simply just tell the computer what to do and you can touch down to the kernel with linux
* this is why linux is very important for every devops engr
* i've decided to venture into cloud, SRE (site reliablility engineering), DevOps and sysadmin stuff.
