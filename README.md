## Here are some of my linux notes
In my latest lab, I focused on fundamental Linux commands for identifying user and system information—small commands, but very useful in everyday system work.

What I practiced:

Using whoami to identify the current logged-in user

Displaying the system date and time with date

Formatting output using options like +%R (time) and +%x (date)

Running multiple commands on a single line using a semicolon

This lab reinforced how efficiency in the command line comes from understanding simple tools and combining them effectively. These basics show up everywhere in scripting, automation, and system administration, so mastering them early matters.
