Many applications contain event-driven parts.
00:03
For example, an application that lets users upload images.
00:07
When that event takes place, the image might need to be processed in a few different ways, like converting
00:12
the image to a standard format, converting a thumbnail into different sizes, and storing each new file in a repository.
00:22
This function could be integrated into the application, but then you’d have to provide compute resources for it–whether it happens once a millisecond or once a day.
00:31
With Cloud Run functions, you write a single-purpose function that completes the necessary image manipulations and then arrange for it to automatically run whenever a new image is uploaded.
00:43
Cloud Run functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose
00:49
functions that respond to cloud events, without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment.
00:57
These functions can be used to construct application workflows from individual business logic tasks.
01:03
Cloud Run functions can also connect and extend cloud services.
01:08
You’re billed to the nearest 100 milliseconds, but only while your code is running.
01:14
Cloud Run functions supports writing source code in a number of programming languages.
01:19
These include Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .
01:24
Net Core, Ruby, and PHP.
01:29
For more information about the supported specific version, refer to the runtimes documentation.
01:36
Events from Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub can trigger Cloud Run functions asynchronously, or you can use HTTP invocation for synchronous execution.
