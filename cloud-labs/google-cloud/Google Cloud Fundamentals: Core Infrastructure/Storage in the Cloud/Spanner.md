The third core storage option offered by Google Cloud is Spanner.

Spanner is a fully managed relational database service that scales horizontally, is strongly consistent, and speaks SQL.

Battle tested by Google’s own mission-critical applications and services, Spanner is the service that powers Google’s $80 billion business.

Spanner is especially suited for applications that require a SQL relational database management system with joins and

secondary indexes, built-in high availability, strong global consistency, and high numbers of input and output operations per second.

We’re talking tens of thousands of reads and writes per second or more.
