So what is DevOps?
00:07
To understand what it is, you first need to understand why DevOps exists.
00:12
Traditionally, IT teams consist of developers and operators.
00:17
Developers are responsible for writing code for systems and operators are responsible for ensuring that those systems operate reliably, so customers are happy.
00:26
Developers are expected to be agile and are often pushed to write and deploy new code as quickly as possible.
00:33
Essentially, developers want to work faster, innovating, and succeeding or failing quickly.
00:40
This resulted in developers throwing their code over the wall to operators who then had to
00:45
deal with code that was written without much understanding of how it would run in production.
00:50
Operators who are expected to keep systems stable would prefer to work slower, focusing on reliability and consistency.
00:58
Quite understandably, this way of working wasn't sustainable between these two groups.
01:04
Their priorities caused tension between the two teams, and they were not necessarily aligned with the needs of the business.
01:11
As a way to knock down the wall and close the gap between developers and operators, a culture instead of practices known as DevOps was born.
01:19
Let's take a look at how Google categorizes DevOps.
01:23
There are five key areas.
01:25
The first is to reduce organizational silos.
01:28
You can increase and foster collaboration by breaking down barriers across teams.
01:33
Second, you need to accept failure is normal.
01:37
Computers are inherently unreliable, so you can't expect perfect execution, and when you introduce humans into the system, you get even more imperfection.
01:47
Things failing will inevitably become part of the process.
01:51
Third, you'll want to implement gradual change.
01:55
Small incremental changes are easier to review, and if a gradual change does release a bug
02:00
in production, it allows you to reduce the time to recover making it simple to roll back.
02:07
Fourth, you need to leverage tooling and automation.
02:11
Identifying manual work that you can then automate is key to helping your IT team work efficiently and focus on the tasks that matter.
02:19
Finally, you'll want to measure everything.
02:22
Measurement is a critical gauge for success.
02:25
There's no way to tell whether what you're doing is successful if you have no way to measure it.
02:31
It's important to understand that DevOps is a philosophy versus a development methodology or technology.
02:38
Although DevOps philosophy highlights critical ways for IT teams to operate, it doesn't give explicit guidance on how an organization should implement practices to be successful.
02:49
That's where SRE comes in.
02:52
So what is SRE?
02:54
SRE evolved at Google in early 2000's separately from DevOps.
02:59
Back in 2003, Benjamin Treynor Sloss, currently a VP of engineering at Google, was tasked
03:05
with managing a team of engineers who are responsible for keeping Google's websites up and running.
03:10
You're probably wondering, "Wait, so a bunch of software engineers who write the code now also
03:16
have to be responsible for running their production systems? But doesn't the Ops team do that?"
03:21
Well the answer at least traditionally is yes.
03:26
However, this team only had software engineers, so Ben had them spend some of their time on operations tasks in addition to development tasks.
03:34
So they could better understand how their code ran and production.
03:37
This way of working is what led the team to site reliability engineering and the associated job role were SREs, who are generally engineers, are responsible for operations.
03:49
Just as DevOps aims to close the gap between software development and software operations, this new SRE approach is a concrete way to solve problems that the DevOps philosophy addresses.
04:01
Note that SRE is both a practice and a role.
04:05
Not every organization that follows SRE principles necessarily must have engineers with the title SRE.
04:12
This course mostly focuses on the practices and principles themselves, things like titles and team structures are implementation details.
04:20
Several SRE practices align to Google's categorizations of DevOps, and in addition to implementing SRE technical practices, you'll also want to implement cultural practices.
04:31
Without a culture to sustain them, it is not possible to maintain the practical aspects of SRE.
04:37
Let me explain where these fundamentals fit into the key areas of DevOps we discussed.
04:42
With regard to reducing organizational silos, SREs share ownership of production with developers.
04:49
Together they define service level objectives or SLOs and error budgets, and share responsibility of how they determine reliability and prioritize work.
04:59
Culturally, this promotes shared vision and knowledge as a well as a need for improved collaboration and communications.
05:07
Complex systems fail in interesting and complex ways.
05:11
Accepting failure as normal state is an important practice within SRE.
05:16
A blameless postmortem is held after an incident to improve the understanding of the failure mode
05:21
and to identify effective preventive actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of a similar incident.
05:28
Learning from incidents in this matter requires a culture of psychological safety and blamelessness.
05:34
When implementing gradual change, SREs aim to reduce the cost of failure by rolling out changes to a small percentage of users before making them generally available.
05:43
Culturally, this promotes more of design thinking and prototyping.
05:48
Next, in order to leverage tooling and automation.
05:52
SREs focus on toil automation reducing the amount of manual repetitive work.
05:57
Automating this year's job away can undoubtedly be met by resistance, that's why teams need to talk
06:03
about and understand the psychology of change and how to address resistance to change within the team.
06:09
Finally, measuring everything means that SREs work to measure everything related to toil, reliability, and the health of their systems.
06:18
To foster these practices, organizations need a culture of goal setting, transparency, and data-driven decision-making.
06:26
Before diving into each of these pillars as they relate to SRE, I want to acknowledge
06:30
that sometimes people can see these practices aligning with different or many of the pillars of DevOps.
06:37
It is likewise important to acknowledge that the language and definitions across different organizations, are less critical than
06:43
driving towards the goal of your organization, and the outcomes you are trying to deliver for your customers.
06:49
In other words, we may disagree on the precise terminology, but many of the underlying principles are the same.
06:56
The goal of SRE is to serve the business and the user, not the other way round.
07:01
The next three modules will dig a bit deeper into all of these SRE practices and cultural concepts.
